## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Senior Full-Stack & Software Engineer** with deep expertise in **PHP (Laravel)** and modern **JavaScript frameworks (React & Vue.js)**.  
I focus not only on writing code, but on **engineering robust, scalable, and maintainable systems**.

In parallel, I work as a **Technical Product Manager**, ensuring alignment between **business goals, system design, and delivery execution**.

## 🏗 Software Engineering Focus

- Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles  
- Scalable System Design & Modular Codebases  
- Design Patterns & Best Practices  
- Performance, Security & Reliability  
- Maintainability & Developer Experience (DX)  
- Writing code that scales with **teams**, not just traffic  

> *Engineering is not about writing more code — it’s about making the right decisions.*
